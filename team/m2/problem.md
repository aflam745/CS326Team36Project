# Problem Statement

## Problem Description
When traveling on vacation people do not know the area very well and want to explore as many different attractions and do
as many activities as possible in the time they are there. The current problem with this is there is no quick or cheap way to
plan a daily itinerary to organize everything you want to do in an optimal way to reduce the traveling time between each location you want to visit.
If wanted to do this now you would have to spend hours manually comparing the distance between each location or
paying for a travel agent to help you plan your trip.

## Proposed Solution

Our web application, **ItineraryPlanner**, aims to solve this problem by providing users with a comprehensive itinerary planning application.
ItineraryPlanner will take all of the locations a user wants to visit and give them an optimal itinerary to minimize the users travel time.

Key Features:

- **Categorize**: Will allow users to add specifications to each location so the itinerary can be further optimized, taking into account things like estimated time of completion.
- **Customization**: The user will be able customize how many locations they will want to visit in a day or how many hours they want the itinerary to be.
- **History**: Users will be able to save the itineraries that are generated and favorite the ones they like the most to look back at them for future reference.
- **Multi-Device Access**: Accessible on both desktop and mobile devices, allowing users to plan trips on the go.

By having advanced scheduling algorithms and multiple advanced scheduling features, ItineraryPlanner makes planning your dream trip as easy as clicking a button.

## Why this matters

In today's world, work hours are getting longer, school is getting harder, and people's overall stressors are growing. Thats why its more important than ever to be able
to kick back, relax, and go on an awesome trip. The last thing people want when they finally get to get away from their hectic lives is to have to stress about planning how
they are going to get everywhere they want to go. Sure they can go spend even more money for a personal travel agent or they could just use ItineraryPlanner and click a few buttons and
have the perfect trip planned out for them!
