# Problem Statement

## Problem Description
When traveling on vacation people do not know the area very well and want to explore as many different attractions and do
as many activities as possible in the time they are there. The current problem with this is there is no quick or cheap way to
plan a daily itinerary to organize everything you want to do in an optimal way to reduce the traveling between each location you want to visit. If wanted to do this know you would have to spend hours manually comparing the distance between each location or
paying for a travel planner to help you plan your trip.
