# Target Users

## Primary Audience

The primary users of our itinerary planner web application are young adults, although people of any age can use it, who are looking to go on vacation and have a list of places they would like to visit but have a limited amount of time.

These individuals will likely have a stable income and job that allows for a vacation, and it is likely they will have relatively high familiarity with technology such that they would be looking for an efficient web application to give them a good itinerary.

The users will also likely be individuals that do not have the time or want to plan out these activities themselves and would prefer an automated way of going about it.
