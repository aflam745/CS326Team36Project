# Target Users

## Primary Audience

The primary users of our itinerary planner web application are young adults, although people of any age can use it, who are looking to go on vacation and have a list of places they would like to visit but have a limited amount of time.

These individuals will likely have a stable income and job that allows for a vacation, and it is likely they will have relatively high familiarity with technology such that they would be looking for an efficient web application to give them a good itinerary.

The users will also likely be individuals that do not have the time or want to plan out these activities themselves and would prefer an automated way of going about it.

## User Needs

Going on vacation should be a time of relaxation and comfort; however, planning the itinerary can be a pain and even introduce stress. Our application aims to remove this additional stress by giving the user the best itinerary for their needs while being conscious of time constraints.

Young adults in particular may be exceedingly busy, so the application should provide a simple yet fast and effective interface which they can quickly use to get a schedule that meets their needs.

Older adults may require a more granular control of what exactly they want to do, so our application may also introduce further constraints that one can add to get a better match for a schedule.
